# Re-implement RSI/MACD logic here to patch the cloned repo locally in Colab
# (Since the repo on GitHub doesn't have these changes yet, we patch them on the fly
# or better yet, we assume the user pushes the advanced code to a new branch)
# BUT, since we are in a 'new folder' workflow, the user might want a zip of the code.
# Let's assume we proceed by uploading the CODE from the new folder.
